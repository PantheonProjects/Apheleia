# Apheleia 
Apheleia is a lightweight pastebin web application built using Perl.

## Why the name?
Apheleia is the Greek goddess of simplicity, prudence, and modesty. We chose this name for our pastebin project because we believe in the power of simplicity and minimalism in software design. With Apheleia, we strive to provide a simple, fast, and elegant solution for online pasting and sharing.
